# Nth Roots of Unity

## A Journey through Complex Numbers

The nth roots of unity are the complex numbers z that satisfy the equation:

\[ z^n = 1 \]

For any positive integer n, there are exactly n complex numbers that satisfy this equation.

## Properties

1. All nth roots of unity lie on the unit circle
2. They are evenly spaced around the circle
3. They form a cyclic group under multiplication

The kth root is given by:

\[ \omega_k = e^{2\pi i k/n} = \cos(2\pi k/n) + i\sin(2\pi k/n) \]

where k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1
